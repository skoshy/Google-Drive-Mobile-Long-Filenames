# Google Drive Mobile Long Filenames

Filenames are cut off in Google Drive on mobile. This userscript can be used in TamperMonkey for a browser like Kiwi on Android to show the full filename.
Uses the `aria-label` to do this; it's hacky and shows some metadata, like the type of the file before the filename, but it works so oh well.
